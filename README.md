# Rhythmically Generating an Audio Virtual Reality Experience
## Abstract

This project investigates the use of an onset detection algorithm to produce an audio responsive game in virtual reality. Traditional music games of this kind typically use a handcrafted approach when creating rhythmic systems. An onset detection algorithm would reduce or remove the need for this style of approach and could reduce development time for these games while allowing for future expandability. This project uses C# and Unity to create a game that demonstrates an implementation of this onset detection driven approach.

## Information

This project was developed as my Final Year Project submission during my fourth (4th) year at Dublin Institute of Technology. It was my first time developing a project using Unity, and was also my first time developing in C#.

The implementation provided is not fully complete, and it lacks flair. The general idea behind the project is implemented to some capacity though, and I believe it demonstrates the vision I had well.

## Demonstration

I have created some videos to demonstrate this project in use. They cover a range of different genres:
